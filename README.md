## Playing the Game
As with normal hangman games, the player start with a secret, hidden word, denoted by the blank spaces at the bottom left of the screen (in red).

The player can guess letters in the word using the text box and submitting the letter using the submit button, or start a new game (in blue).

All letters that have been guessed are shown in the letter bank in the top left-hand side for the player's ease (in green).

The number of guesses left is depicted in the top right along with the hangman that is slowly created as the number of guesses dwindle down (in purple).
